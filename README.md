📊 Machine Learning Programs Repository

This repository is a well-structured collection of Machine Learning programs, developed using Python to understand the end-to-end machine learning workflow — from raw data to trained and evaluated models.

Each program focuses not just on implementation, but also on conceptual clarity, making this repository suitable for learning, revision, and academic reference.

This repository was created to:

-- Build strong foundational knowledge of Machine Learning

-- Practice algorithm implementation from scratch and using libraries

-- Understand real-world ML workflows

-- Serve as a revision and reference guide

-- Prepare for academics, interviews, and projects

After working through these programs, you will be able to:

-- Understand how ML algorithms work internally

-- Preprocess and analyze datasets

-- Train and evaluate ML models

-- Choose appropriate algorithms for different problems
